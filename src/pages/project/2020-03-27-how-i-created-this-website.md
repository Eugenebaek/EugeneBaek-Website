This website was created with the **JAMstack architecture** in mind. 

But, what is JAMstack? 

Well, the *JAM* part of the JAMstack is a concatenation for JavaScript, API, and Markup. Essentially, it's a new way of making web apps. 

You can read more about what JAMstack is from this great article by [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/blog/jamstack). 



For my JAMstack website, I used GatbsyJS as my static site generator.
